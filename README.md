[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Hritikrai55/Bike_Sharing_Demand_Prediction__ML_Regression_Project/blob/main/Bike_Sharing_Demand_Prediction.ipynb)

A comprehensive machine learning project to predict hourly bike rental demand using the Seoul Bike Sharing dataset. This project implements regression models to forecast bike sharing demand based on environmental and temporal factors.

## 🎯 Project Overview

The primary aim of this project is to develop an accurate predictive model utilizing the Seoul Bike Sharing dataset. The objective is to forecast the hourly demand for rental bikes, considering the bike count and a wide range of environmental variables recorded from December 2017 to November 2018. 

By leveraging advanced machine learning techniques, the model provides reliable estimates for the number of rental bikes required per hour, enabling effective resource management and allocation for bike-sharing services.
